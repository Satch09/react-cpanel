# Client Panel

This is my first app built as part of the 'React Front to Back' course which I have almost completed.

I feel that I have learned so much and in doing so have realised that I know so little.

I'm super excited about getting this up and running!

## Goals

My overall aim is to combine and apply all the tools, methods and workflows introduced into this course in while also attempting to implement meaningful documentation as well as source control.

I would like to accomplish all of this through the application of industry best practices which I will most likely learn as I go along.

## Tools used

- React
- Redux
- Firebase

## Deployment

I have not yet decided how I shall deploy this app. For now it will most likely be GH pages as this is what I am currently familiar with. But this too I shall be investigating.
